ARAGORN, My lord Elrond ,The Return of the King 
ELROND,I come on behalf of one whom I love.  Arwen is dying.  She will not long     survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.  The light of the evenstar is     failing.  As Sauron's power grows her strength wanes.  Arwen's life is now     tied to the fate of the Ring.  The Shadow is upon us Aragorn.  The end has     come. ,The Return of the King 
ARAGORN,"It will not be our end, but his.   ",The Return of the King 
ELROND,"  You ride to war     but not to victory.  Sauron's armies ride on Minas Tirith, this you know.      But in secret he sends another force, which will attack, from the river.    , A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the South.  They will be     in the city in two days.  You're outnumbered Aragorn.  You need more men. ",The Return of the King 
ARAGORN,There are none. ,The Return of the King 
ELROND, There are those that dwell in the mountain.   ,The Return of the King

ARAGORN,Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil.   ,The Return of the King 
ARAGORN,The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.   ,The Return of the King 
ELROND,The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army     more deadly than any that walks this earth.  Put aside the Ranger.  Become     who you were born to be 'nen i-Estel Edain.  ,The Return of the King 
ARAGORN, '-chebin Estel anim.   ,The Return of the King 
EOWYN,Why are you doing this?  The war lies to the East.  You cannot leave on     the eve of battle.  You cannot abandon the men.   ,The Return of the King 
PIPPIN,What were you thinking Peregrin Took?  What service can a Hobbit offer     such a great lord of men?    ,The Return of the King 
FARAMIR," ,  It was     well done.  A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel.     ,     You are to join the tower guard. ",The Return of the King 
PIPPIN,I didn't think they would find any livery that would  fit me.  ,The Return of the King 
FARAMIR,It once belonged to a young boy of the city.  A very foolish one who     wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending his studies.   ,The Return of the King 
PIPPIN,This was yours?   ,The Return of the King 
FARAMIR,"Yes, it was mine.  My father had it made for me.   ",The Return of the King

EOWYN,We need you here.   ,The Return of the King 
ARAGORN,Why have you come? ,The Return of the King 
EOWYN,Do you not know? ,The Return of the King 
ARAGORN,It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.  I cannot give you what     you seek.  ,The Return of the King 
ARAGORN, I have wished you joy since first I saw you.  ,The Return of the King 
GIMLI, Just where do you     think you're off to? ,The Return of the King 
ARAGORN,Not this time.  This time you must stay Gimli.  ,The Return of the King 
GIMLI, Hmmmm ,The Return of the King 
LEGOLAS, Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness of     dwarves?   ,The Return of the King 
GIMLI,You might as well accept it.  We're going with you laddie.  Aragorn     smiles. ,The Return of the King 
SOLDIER,"What's happening, where is he going?  I don't understand.  (, Lord Aragorn!  Why does     he leave on the eve of battle?   ",The Return of the King 
GAMLING,He leaves because there is no hope. ,The Return of the King 
THEODEN,He leaves because he must.   ,The Return of the King 
PIPPIN,"Well, I'm taller than you were then.  Though, I'm not likely to grow     anymore, except sideways.   ",The Return of the King 
FARAMIR,"It never fitted me either.  Boromir was always the soldier.     ,  They were so alike he and     my father.  Proud, stubborn even, but strong.   ",The Return of the King 
PIPPIN,I think you have strength of a different kind.  And one day your father     will see it.   ,The Return of the King 
PIPPIN,"Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor in peace or war, in living     or dying, from , ' from this hour henceforth     until my lord release me or death take me. ",The Return of the King 
DENETHOR,"And I shall not forget it! ,  nor fail to reward  that which is given.     ,      Fealty with love.  ,      Valour with honour.  Disloyalty with vengeance.      ,      I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defences.  Defences     that your brother long held intact.   ",The Return of the King 
FARAMIR,What would you have me do? ,The Return of the King 
DENETHOR,I will not yield the River and Pellenor unfought.  Osgiliath must be     retaken.   ,The Return of the King 
FARAMIR,My lord Osgiliath is over run.   ,The Return of the King 
DENETHOR,Much must be risked in war.    Is there a Captain here who still has the     courage to do his lord's will?   ,The Return of the King 
FARAMIR,You wish now that our places had been exchanged.  That I had died and     Boromir had lived.   ,The Return of the King 
DENETHOR,"Yes, I wish that.   ",The Return of the King 
GAMLING,To few have come.  We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.   ,The Return of the King 
THEODEN," No, we cannot.  But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.      ",The Return of the King 
THEODEN,"I have left instruction. , The people are to follow your rule in     my stead.     Take up my seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you defend Edoras, if the     battle goes ill.  ",The Return of the King 
EOWYN,What other duty would you have me do my lord? ,The Return of the King 
THEODEN,"Duty? ,     no. , I     would have you smile again, not grieve for those whose time has come. You     shall live to see these days renewed , ' and no more despair ",The Return of the King 
FARAMIR,"Since you are robbed of Boromir I will do what I can in his stead.     ,     If I should return, think better of me father.  ",The Return of the King 
DENETHOR,That will depend on the manner of your return.   ,The Return of the King 
GOLLUM, Ech!  ,The Return of the King 
SAM,What are you up to?  Sneaking off are we?   ,The Return of the King 
GOLLUM,"Sneaking?  Sneaking?  Fat Hobbit is always so polite.  Smeagol shows     them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say 'sneak!'  Sneak?      Very nice friend, oh yes my precious very nice , very nice! ",The Return of the King 
SAM,Alright!  Alright!  You just startled me is all.  What were you doing?      ,The Return of the King 
GOLLUM,Sneaking. ,The Return of the King

SAM,He took it.  He must have.  ,The Return of the King 
GOLLUM,"Smeagol?  No, no, not poor Smeagol.  Smeagol hates nasty elf bread.      ",The Return of the King 
SAM,You're a lying rat!  What did you do with it?   ,The Return of the King 
FRODO,"  He doesn't     eat it. , He can't have taken     it.   ",The Return of the King 
GOLLUM," Look, what's this?  ,  Crumbs on his jacketses.  He took it! ,He took it! ,  I've seen him, he's always stuffing his face when master's     not looking. ",The Return of the King

FRODO,Sam!   ,The Return of the King 
SAM,Call me' ,The Return of the King

SAM, I'll kill him! ,The Return of the King 
FRODO," Sam, no!   ",The Return of the King 
SAM," Oh my!   I'm sorry.  I didn't mean it to go so far.  I was just     so, so angry!  Here just' let's just rest a bit. ",The Return of the King 
FRODO, I'm all right.   ,The Return of the King 
SAM,"No.  No you're not all right, you're exhausted.  It's that Gollum.  It's     this place.  It's that thing around your neck.  , I could help a bit.  I could carry it for     a while ,,     carry it for a while ,      I could carry it' I could carry it' Share the load' share the load' share     the load  ",The Return of the King

SMEAGOL,"And they doesn't taste very nice, does they Precious? ",The Return of the King 
GOLLUM,"No, not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats.    ,     Hobbit meat. And when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes     , then we will find it. ",The Return of the King 
SMEAGOL,And take it for Meee! ,The Return of the King

GANDALF,"The wealth of Moria is not in gold, or jewels, but Mithril ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
GANDALF,Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
GIMLI,Aww that was a Kingly gift ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
GANDALF,"Yes.  I never told him, but its worth was greater than     the value of The Shire!  ",The Fellowship of the Ring

PIPPIN,Why are they still guarding it?  ,The Return of the King 
GANDALF,"They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one     day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once     was before it fell into decay. ,     The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more     splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their     descent , dearer than the names of their sons.    ,     Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers     asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.    ,     The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was     given over to lesser men.",The Return of the King 
PIPPIN,Mordor. ,The Return of the King 
GANDALF,"Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow. ",The Return of the King 
PIPPIN,A storm is coming. ,The Return of the King 
GANDALF,"This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron's     making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have     no love of daylight, so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage     along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will     begin. ",The Return of the King 
PIPPIN,"Well' Minas Tirith' very impressive. ,So where are off to next? ",The Return of the King 
GANDALF,"Oh, it's too late for that Peregrin. There's no leaving this city.    ,     Help must come to us.",The Return of the King

GANDALF,Indeed? ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
FRODO,"We never had any adventures, or did anything     unexpected.       ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
GANDALF,"If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I     was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the     door.       ",The Fellowship of the Ring

FRODO,I'm not sending him away. ,The Return of the King 
SAM,You don't see it do you? He's a villain. ,The Return of the King

FRODO,Gollum! ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
GANDALF,He's been following us for three days ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
FRODO,He escaped the dungeons of Barad-D'r! ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
GANDALF,"Escaped ,     or was set loose and now the Ring has drawn him here ,      He won't ever be rid of his need for it.  He hates and loves the Ring,     as he hates and loves himself.  Smeagol's life is a sad story    ,  Yes    , he was once called, before the Ring     found him. Before it drove him mad ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
FRODO,It's a pity Bilbo didnt kill him when he had the chance ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
GANDALF,"Pity ?  It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.      Many that live deserve death and many that die, deserve life. Can you give     it to them Frodo ? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even     the very wise cannot see all ends.  My heart tells me that Gollum has     some part to play, yet for good or ill.... before this is over.     ,     The pity of Bilbo, may rule the fate of many  ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
FRODO,I wish the Ring had never come to me.  I wish none of     this had happened. ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
GANDALF,"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for     them to decide.  All we have to decide is what to do with the time that     is given to us.  There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo,     besides the will of evil.  Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which     case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought.        Oh! Its that way ",The Fellowship of the Ring

EOWYN,"I dreamed I saw a great wave climbing over green lands and above the     hills. I stood upon the brink. It was utterly dark in the abyss before my     feet. A light shone behind me but I could not turn ,     I could only stand there, waiting. ",The Return of the King

FRODO,What are they ? ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
STRIDER,"They were once men. Great Kings of Men.  The Sauron     the Deciever  gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed     they took them without question.

GANDALF,He's very fond of you. ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
BILBO,"I know, he'd probably come with me if I asked him to. I     think in his heart Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods, the     fields and the little rivers. I am old Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but     I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. , I feel     thin, sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a     holiday, a very long holiday.

GANDALF,What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?      ,The Return of the King 
GANDALF,There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool but an honest fool he remains.     ,The Return of the King 
GANDALF,"He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. ,We've been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the Palantir a glimpse     of the enemy's plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.    ",The Return of the King 
GAN DALF,"His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.    , He knows the Heir of     Elendil has come forth ,     Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough,     perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples     of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. , He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground    , before he     sees a King return to the throne of men.
